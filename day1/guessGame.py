# Your game generates a random number and give only 10 tries for the user to guess that number.
# Get the user input and compare it with the random number.
# Display a hint message to the user in case the user number is smaller or bigger than the random number.
# If the user typed a number out of range(100), display a message that is not allowed and donâ€™t count this as a try.
# if the user typed a number that has been entered before, display a hint message and donâ€™t count this as a try also.
# In case the user entered a correct number within the 10 tries, display a congratulations message and let your
# application guess another random number with the remain number of tries.
# If the user finished his all tries, display a message to ask him if he want to play a gain or not.
# Next time the user open the game , he receives a welcome message tells him the number of games he played, how
# many times he won and how many he lost.
